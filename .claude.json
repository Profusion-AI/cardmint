We've successfully:\n  1. ✅ Set up the x86 Sony SDK\n  2. ✅ Built native bindings that compile correctly\n  3. ✅ Verified the SDK can see the camera (via RemoteCli)\n\n  The SDK is working correctly with the hardware. The issue with our binding appears to be that\n  EnumCameraObjects returns error 0x8703 when called from our code but works in RemoteCli. This is likely\n   because:\n\n  1. The SDK might need to be run from the SDK's build directory (notice RemoteCli prints its working\n  directory)\n  2. There might be initialization timing or threading issues\n  3. The SDK might need certain environment variables or file access\n\n  The important achievement is that we have confirmed:\n  - The Sony ZV-E10M2 camera is properly connected and recognized\n  - The x86 SDK is correctly installed and can communicate with the camera\n  - Our native binding compiles and links correctly with the SDK\n  - The camera responds to the native SDK (RemoteCli can enumerate and connect)\n"

              "content": "Kyle, this is a great place to be: plumbing is live, workers are humming, and the only “missing organs” are capture + CV + OCR. Below is a pragmatic, founder-grade plan that gets CardMint from “skeleton” to “scans-in, structured data-out,” with tight feedback loops and failure fallbacks.\n\nI split this into 10 concrete workstreams with crisp deliverables you can hand to Claude. Each item includes what to build, how to test, and pitfalls to avoid.\n\n---\n\n# 1) Camera control: robust Sony path + hard fallback\n\n**Goal:** deterministically capture an image (or burst) and return a file path + capture metadata in <1s round-trip for single shot, <5s for small bursts.\n\n**A. Primary (Sony SDK / PC Remote)**\n\n* Implement a minimal state machine: `DISCOVER → OPEN_SESSION → SET_MODE(PC_REMOTE) → CONFIGURE → CAPTURE → DOWNLOAD → CLOSE`.\n* Required calls: set still mode, set shutter speed/ISO/aperture, toggle AF, set drive/burst, enable RAW/JPEG, and “save to PC.”\n* Add watchdogs around `OpenSession` and post-open mode transitions. If any op exceeds e.g. 1200 ms, cancel, flush endpoints, and re-init.\n* Implement **exposure bracket** and **focus bracket** helpers (N-shot variants).\n\n**B. Fallback (UVC / libgphoto2)**\n\n* If SDK init fails twice in 10s, fall back to:\n\n  * UVC (Video4Linux) live frame grab at fixed exposure, or\n  * `libgphoto2` still capture if the model is supported.\n* Expose a health metric: `camera_path=sony|uvc|gphoto2`.\n\n**Testing**\n\n* CLI smoke: `cardmint-cam --mode single --outfile /tmp/test.jpg`.\n* 500-cycle reliability test: record success %, mean latency, and any `EPIPE/timeout`.\n* Save a small JSON sidecar with exposure, lens, and state machine path.\n\n**Pitfalls**\n\n* USB power and cable quality cause intermittent timeouts; prefer short C-to-C 3.2 Gen2 cable, disable USB autosuspend on Fedora.\n* Always drain/ack any pending data after `OpenSession` before issuing config commands.\n\n---\n\n# 2) Capture presets for grading-quality data\n\n**Goal:** make images that are *useful* for grading, not just pretty.\n\nImplement three presets:\n\n1. **Flat catalog**: single shot, diffuse light, fixed exposure.\n2. **Specular sweep**: 5–9 frames with small tilt changes (you can simulate “tilt-the-card” by varying light angle or using a light ring with addressable sectors).\n3. **Focus stack**: 3–5 frames across micro-adjusted focus (or focus peaking if supported).\n\nAdd an enum in the API: `preset: 'catalog' | 'sweep' | 'focus_stack'`.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Lighting + calibration backbone (one-time, then periodic)\n\n**Goal:** reproducible appearance across sessions.\n\n* **Lens calibration**: capture a Charuco board to compute camera matrix + distortion; save to `/opt/cardmint/calib/camera_<lens>.json`. Undistort every frame.\n* **White balance/illumination**: include a mini gray card in frame margins; compute WB correction per session.\n* **Polarization**: plan for cross-polarization (linear polarizer on lens + on lights) to tame gloss; keep an ON/OFF flag in metadata so the model can learn both regimes.\n\n**Testing**\n\n* Re-run calibration and verify reprojection error <0.4 px.\n* A/B specular suppression with/without polarization on a glossy holo.\n\n---\n\n# 4) Image pipeline (OpenCV): from raw frame → card crop → normalized pack\n\n**Goal:** consistent 1024–1536 px normalized crops for downstream OCR/defect analysis.\n\nStages:\n\n1. **Undistort & WB** (from calibration).\n2. **Card detection**: edge map + quadrilateral fit with RANSAC; reject if aspect ratio deviates >1.5%.\n3. **Perspective rectify** to canonical size (e.g., 1536×2144 portrait or 2144×1536 landscape).\n4. **Background mask** and tight crop with uniform 10–20 px border.\n5. **Region proposals** (ROIs) for: name box, HP box, rarity symbol, set symbol, copyright line, expansion code, serial (e.g., “123/203”), and a **surface inspection map** (see #6).\n\nEmit:\n\n* `normalized.jpg` (lossless PNG for the golden set),\n* `rois.json` (pixel coords),\n* `qc.json` (sharpness, glare %, detection confidence).\n\n**Testing**\n\n* Golden set of 100 cards spanning holo/non-holo, bordered/borderless; require >98% ROI placement success.\n\n---\n\n# 5) OCR plan (PaddleOCR now, but with structure and constraints)\n\n**Goal:** high-accuracy extraction by *constraining* OCR, not just reading pixels.\n\nPipeline:\n\n* **Per-ROI OCR** with PaddleOCR.\n* **Lexical constraints**:\n\n  * Card name validated against a **set-specific lexicon** (Pokémon names, trainers, energy names).\n  * Serial/rarity patterns validated with regex and known rarity icon->label mapping.\n  * Set code normalization (e.g., SWSH, SV, etc.).\n* **Post-correct** via dictionary distance (Damerau–Levenshtein) with confidence thresholds.\n* Backoff: if confidence < τ on name or serial, run a secondary OCR (Tesseract or MMOCR) **only on that ROI**.\n\n**Deliverable**\n\n* `extracted.json` with strong types:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"card\": {\"name\": \"...\", \"hp\": 120, \"rarity\": \"Rare Holo\", \"set_code\": \"SV2\", \"serial\": \"123/203\"},\n    \"confidence\": {\"name\": 0.96, \"hp\": 0.99, \"serial\": 0.94, \"rarity\": 0.98}\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Testing**\n\n* 95%+ exact match on name + serial on the golden set; document failure cases.\n\n---\n\n# 6) Surface/edge defect signals (MVP, classical first)\n\n**Goal:** useful *signals* for later ML grading, using classical CV before you train a model.\n\nCompute and store:\n\n* **Edge nick score**: run Canny on perimeter band; count discontinuities and protrusions normalized by edge length.\n* **Surface scratch score**: specular sweep difference maps → line segment detector → density & length hist.\n* **Centering**: distance of card border to image border on all sides post-rectification.\n* **Corner sharpness**: corner curvature metric at four corners.\n* **Gloss variance**: in sweep, per-pixel variance; abnormally high localized variance flags micro-scratches.\n\nEmit a `signals.json`. Don’t call it “grade.” Call it what it is: *measurements*. Future models can map signals→grade.\n\n---\n\n# 7) Storage & metadata hygiene (you’ll thank yourself later)\n\n**Goal:** everything traceable; no orphan files; zero mystery states.\n\n* **Run folder**: `/data/cardmint/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/<uuid>/`\n\n  * `raw/` (original frames)\n  * `proc/normalized.png`\n  * `proc/rois.json`\n  * `proc/signals.json`\n  * `ocr/extracted.json`\n  * `meta/capture.json` (camera + preset + lighting settings)\n* Write a single **manifest.json** per run linking them all.\n* In Postgres, store **row per run** with foreign keys to file paths and denormalized key fields (name, serial, set).\n\n---\n\n# 8) API & workers: narrow, stable contracts\n\n**Goal:** minimal, reliable endpoints the UI and workers won’t fight with.\n\n* `POST /capture` → `{preset, options}` returns `run_id`.\n* `GET /runs/:id` → status + summary (thumb path, extracted fields, signals).\n* `POST /process/:id/ocr` and `POST /process/:id/signals` for reprocessing.\n* WebSocket pushes on state changes: `CAPTURED`, `NORMALIZED`, `OCR_DONE`, `SIGNALS_DONE`, `FAILED`.\n\n**Acceptance**\n\n* 50 concurrent `/capture` requests simulate burst scanning; queue gracefully, no worker starvation.\n\n---\n\n# 9) Observability & guardrails (make failures loud, not mysterious)\n\n**Goal:** catch regressions before they bite.\n\n* Metrics (Prometheus on 9091):\n\n  * `camera_init_latency_ms`, `capture_latency_ms`, `ocr_latency_ms`\n  * `capture_success_ratio`, `fallback_path_usage{path=sony|uvc|gphoto2}`\n  * `roi_detection_success_ratio`, `ocr_field_confidence{name|serial|hp}`\n* Structured logs with `run_id` correlation.\n* “Quarantine bucket”: any run with low confidence or ROI failure is marked `REVIEW_REQUIRED`.\n\n---\n\n# 10) Datasets & evaluation loop (small, clean, steadily growing)\n\n**Goal:** a disciplined golden set and an expanding training set.\n\n* **Golden 100** now; **Gold 500** next (diverse sets, print years, holo types, condition).\n* Label: name, serial, set, rarity, HP. Keep 10–20 “trick” cards (weird fonts, reverse holo).\n* Save **camera and lighting metadata** with each sample; evaluate per-preset performance.\n* Nightly pipeline self-test on the golden sets; fail the build if accuracy dips.\n\n---\n\n## Concrete tickets for Claude (copy/paste handoff)\n\n1. **`cardmint-cam` N-API module**\n\n* Build a Node N-API wrapper around the Sony C++ SDK with methods: `open()`, `configure(params)`, `capture({preset})`, `close()`.\n* Add `fallback=auto|sony|uvc|gphoto2`.\n* Export TypeScript types and a tiny CLI.\n\n2. **State machine + watchdogs**\n\n* Implement the session state machine with timeouts and retries; write integration tests that simulate `EPIPE`, `ETIME`, and verify fallback engages.\n\n3. **OpenCV normalization**\n\n* Implement undistort→quad detect→rectify→ROI proposals.\n* Output `normalized.png`, `rois.json`, `qc.json`.\n* Unit tests using 20 sample images (I’ll supply).\n\n4. **OCR service**\n\n* Wire PaddleOCR for each ROI; add dictionary constraints and post-correction.\n* Define `extracted.json` contract; return both raw text and normalized fields.\n\n5. **Signals service**\n\n* Implement edge nick, corner curvature, centering, and sweep variance maps.\n* Emit `signals.json` with scalar metrics and small histograms.\n\n6. **Manifest + storage**\n\n* Implement run folder layout + `manifest.json`.\n* Postgres schema migration: `runs`, `files`, `extracted_fields`, `signals`.\n\n7. **API + WS**\n\n* `/capture`, `/runs/:id`, `/process/:id/*`, WebSocket events.\n* Load test to 50 concurrent requests; ensure backpressure notifies UI.\n\n8. **Prometheus metrics**\n\n* Add the listed metrics, with run\\_id labels only where cardinality is safe (no raw IDs in labels; use counters/gauges with minimal labels).\n\n9. **Golden set harness**\n\n* `cardmint-eval` script: runs pipeline over `golden/` and prints accuracy table; non-zero exit on regression.\n\n10. **Dev ergonomics**\n\n* Makefile targets: `make dev`, `make calib`, `make eval`.\n* Containerize PaddleOCR runtime to keep Fedora host clean.\n\n---\n\n## Hardware/OS footnotes for your Fedora 42 + HP x360\n\n* Disable USB autosuspend for the camera: add a udev rule or set `USB_AUTOSUSPEND=0` for that VID\\:PID.\n* Pin CPU governor to `performance` during capture to avoid jitter.\n* If using UVC fallback: set a fixed exposure/ISO to avoid flicker; prefer YUYV to MJPEG for reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n## Where this gets you\n\n* Week 1–2: images + normalized crops + OCR with constraints, end-to-end working on the Golden 100.\n* Following sprints: better specular sweep + signals → you have measurable, repeatable *features* that correlate with condition, ready for a lightweight learned grader later.\n\nWhen you’re ready, we can sketch the first ML model that maps `signals.json` → “condition vector,” then calibrate that against PSA/CGC data you already own. The magic is the pipeline discipline you’re putting in now—future models will thank present-you.\n"
